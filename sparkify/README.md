here's a step-by-step of what I did:

- reworked file structure of the project to make more organized, modular and readable
- started by making boilerplate more redabale with
    - sections, 
    - uniform spacing and separation, 
    - comply with PEP8,
    - more explicit variable names,
    - more descriptive docstrings and comments

- started designing/writing sql queries to create tables
- refactored conn & cur for connection and cursor in etl.ipynb for clarity
